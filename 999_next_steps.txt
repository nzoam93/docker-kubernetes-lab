## Things to still do:


6. Go through and give more detail to the various parts, especially about K8s
7. Maybe have a references page where they can go to in order to learn more


11. Is the nginx part sufficient?

13. Talk about how docker-compose allows us to run the docker images without needing to make them ourselves (i.e. someone else could have made them and we can just use them)
You can also talk about doing it in detached mode
14. Ensure it still works with new port 80 (instead of 8081 in backend)

15. More info
We tell the master node what to do (through kubectl) and it tells the worker nodes what to do
