<!-- # Getting Started

## Conventions

- use ```bash to have snippet with `Run in terminal` button 

```bash
pwd
```

- use ```console to have snippet to display outputs

```console
eti-lab> pwd
/home/ubuntu
```

- use `.location` encoded in the URL to insert link to a specific URL

```console
[dashboard](http://dashboard.location.hostname:8080)
```

result is: [dashboard](http://dashboard.location.hostname:8080)
