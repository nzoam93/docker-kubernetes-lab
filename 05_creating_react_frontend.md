## Step 3: Creating the React frontend 

In this step, we will be creating a React frontend which the user will use to take the quiz. This frontend is comprised of several different components. The steps for building a React application are outside the scope of this Docker/K8s guide, but you can find more information about creating a React app in the link provided in the Intro section.

For now, let's clone an existing github repo with the frontend already coded. 

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/nzoam93/frontend.git
```

This will create a directory called *frontend* in which we have the necessary React files. 

The frontend gives us a user interface in which the user can actually access the quiz application. The frontend connects with the backend API at the path of *API/questions* that we set up in the backend.

The frontend also has a *build* folder. This build folder was generated by using the *npm run build* command to create an efficient and production-ready build for our React application. It will be this build file that we use to actually deploy our application later in this process.  <br><br>
